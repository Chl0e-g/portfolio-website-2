# Portfolio website

## Introduction
This project is a portfolio website I've created to display my work as a fullstack developer. In addition to having a primary function as my portfolio, I also used this project to learn about the MUI React UI library, and practice building fully responsive websites in React. I designed the website myself on Figma.
